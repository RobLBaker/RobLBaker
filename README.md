### Hello!
I'm an evolutionary plant biologist by training and data scientist by trade. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Open and Fair data and metadata publication guidelines, workflows, and tools for the [National Park Service](https://github.com/nationalparkservice).
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested and excited to collaborate with anyone working on data publication and metadata creation. 

If you're interested in my plant biology work (ğŸ¥¦ğŸ§¬ğŸ”¬ğŸ–¥), please check out my [other GitHub account](https://github.com/rlbaker5).
